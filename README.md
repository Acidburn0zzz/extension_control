Extension Control is a lightweight extension manager designed for those who want essential functionality in an aesthetically pleasing package. The streamlined feature set will enable you to limit resource consumption by letting you choose which extensions you want running at any given time. All from within the convenience of a single menu, that can be accessed directly on your address bar.

## Features

* enable/disable extensions with a single click
* execute an uninstall
* access extension options
* switch between dark and light theme
* set maximum width of the popup
* set the font size

## Why another extension manager

We felt that the current extension managers available for chromium browsers had features we didn't need and mostly dated, bloated design. Extension Control adjusts to your needs and preferences. For example it introduces font shadows specifically for Windows, for better reading. The extension has been tested on Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi, but should generally run just fine on any Chromium browser.
