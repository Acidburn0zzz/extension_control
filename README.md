Extension Control is a lightweight extension manager designed for those who want essential functionality in an aesthetically pleasing package. The streamlined feature set will enable you to limit resource consumption by letting you choose which extensions you want running at any given time. All from within the convenience of a single menu, that can be accessed directly on your address bar.

The menu allows you to:
* enable/disable extensions with a single click
* execute an uninstall
* access extension options

Choose from 2 themes to better fit the various browser configurations available. You can also select the maximum width of the menu, so it can be as compact as you desire.
